## Experiments: Generative 3D UI Concepts

Ten experimental interface prototypes live in `interfaces/`. Open any `index.html` directly in a browser or launch the unified showcase at `interfaces/showcase/index.html` to cycle through all of them.

### Showcase (`interfaces/showcase/index.html`)
- Sidebar picker and keyboard navigation let you flip between every concept.
- Loads each prototype via iframe so you get the full vibe and interactions intact.

### Individual Interfaces
- **Flux Lab** (`interfaces/flux-lab/index.html`): Neon glass lab with nebula pulses and auto-updating procedural script.
- **Retro Synthesis Console** (`interfaces/retro-terminal/index.html`): CRT nostalgia with execution trace tree and hidden glitch operators (`Alt`).
- **Toy Forge Studio** (`interfaces/toy-forge/index.html`): Playful maker panels, flavor chips, and orbiting blobs for toy recipes.
- **Biome Holo Forge** (`interfaces/biome-holo/index.html`): Lush holographic biodome translating eco-layer toggles into code.
- **Cyber Notebook Lab** (`interfaces/cyber-notebook/index.html`): Handwritten cyber notebook that turns doodles into margin scripts.
- **Space Bridge Builder** (`interfaces/space-bridge/index.html`): Spaceship command deck cycling orbit tiers and fabrication modes.
- **Pixel Factory** (`interfaces/pixel-factory/index.html`): Pixel-art machine with swapable palettes and voxel recipe output.
- **Zen Garden Modeler** (`interfaces/zen-garden/index.html`): Calm sand garden with haiku prompts, wind controls, and code reflection.
- **Hyper Scribble Synth** (`interfaces/hyper-scribble/index.html`): Graffiti wall sprays that mix with beat knobs to generate code riffs.
- **Clockwork Studio** (`interfaces/clockwork-studio/index.html`): Steampunk gear room where torque/polish dials influence assembly scripts.
- **Lumen Minimal Studio** (`interfaces/lumen-minimal/index.html`): Minimal monochrome experience with subtle motion and restrained code output.

Experiment, remix, and mash the concepts together. Each is intentionally self-contained so you can copy/paste into other projects or tweak the vibes.
